# R PowerBI Data Visualisation Project
For this project, I used Rstudio to analyse and clean an open source dataset. This included, checking data types, dropping missing values, duplicates and outliers and rounding. I showcase summary statistics, a scatterplot and bar charts. I then imported the clean data into Microsoft Power BI to create a visually pleasing dashboard.  

# Data:
Hollywoods Most Profitable Stories - Title, Genre, Studio, Profitability and Ratings

# Objectives:
- To analyse the performance of Hollywood movies
- Create dashboard in Power BI to show client requirements

My dashboard shows:
- The average Rotten Tomatoes ratings of each genre
- The number of movies produced per year
- The audience score for each film
- The profitability per studio
- The worldwide gross per genre
- Studio comparison filter
